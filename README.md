# NeetCode 150 — With Intuition

A **pseudocode-first, intuition-driven guide** to mastering the NeetCode 150 problems.  
This repository focuses on **how to think**, not just how to code.

Unlike typical solution repositories, this guide emphasizes **core logic building**, **approach evolution (brute → optimal)**, **pattern recognition**, and **interview-level reasoning**, using **language-agnostic pseudocode** with reference implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.

## 📌 Philosophy

Most DSA repositories answer:

> *“How do I code this?”*

This repository answers:

- What is the problem *really* asking?
- How do you arrive at a solution from first principles?
- Why does one approach outperform another?
- How do you recognize this pattern across problems?
- What alternative data structures or algorithms could also solve it?

The goal is to build **transferable problem-solving intuition**, not rote memorization of solutions.

## 🧠 What Makes This Repository Different

### ✅ Pseudocode-First (Language Independent)
- Every problem is explained using **clear pseudocode**
- Logic is prioritized **before syntax**
- Makes translation to any programming language straightforward

### ✅ Logic Building: Basics → Advanced
- Begin with the most naive or brute-force idea
- Improve incrementally through observations
- Arrive at the optimal approach **naturally**

### ✅ Multiple Perspectives per Problem
Each problem includes:
- Brute-force approach
- Better / optimized approach
- Optimal solution
- Clear reasoning on **why each approach works or fails**

### ✅ Interview-Centric Thinking
- Trade-offs between solutions
- Why one approach is preferred in interviews
- How to **articulate reasoning clearly**, not just write code

### ✅ Pattern Recognition
- Identifies the underlying **DSA pattern**
- Connects problems across domains
- Helps recognize similar problems quickly and confidently
